# The Project 

This is my final project for Technigo Frontend Boot Camp. 
The project is a site called En Bostad where users can find available rental apartments in Stockholm. The apartments can be found in a list fetched from Bostadsf√∂rmedlingen as well as on a Map that is created with Google Maps React.
The user can also sign up to create a profile where saved apartments will be stored.

## Future improvments

I plan on continuously working on this project after the Boot Camp. 
- I would like to add a delete function to the listings that the user has saved to its profile. 
- I would like to add a sort function for apartment list so that the user can sort the apartments based on apartment size and price.
- I would like to connect the list to the map so that the user can click on the card and find the apartment on the map and vice versa.
